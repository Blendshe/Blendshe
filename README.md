### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning software development with TechEd.

I came across the TechEd bootcamp on the Reddit Liverpool thread and sent a message that I was interested.  I joined the free bootcamp in December 2023, it was a full day online and I loved it! I decided to find out ore abou the Fullstack Bootcamp to explore if that was something I would particpate in. 

I joined the evening Fullstack bootcamp which began in January 2023. 

The time has gone really fast so far, I'm ha;fway through and have learned a lot. Some of it has been really enjoyable and other parts I have more work to do to fully understand and be able to apply the concepts.  

The course has been split into 3 modules and so far have completed 2 and the project i developed for the end of the second project was a photography website, and I really enjoyed it and have decided to continue to develop it in my own time
